🏥 Healthcare Analytics Project — Predicting Patient Test Results

Project Overview: 

    This project aims to apply data science and machine learning techniques to a synthetic healthcare dataset that mirrors real-world hospital records.

    The goal is to use patient, hospital, and medical data to predict medical test outcomes (Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive) and uncover actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.

    The dataset represents data collected across multiple hospitals, doctors, and patients, providing a rich foundation for both predictive modelling and business analytics.

Business Objective:

    Predictive Objective:
    Develop a classification model to predict “Test Results” (Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive).

    Analytical Objective:
    Identify key factors influencing test outcomes such as Age, Medical Condition, Admission Type, and Medication.

    Operational Objective:
    Provide actionable insights to hospital management to:
    •	Prioritize high-risk patients
    •	Optimize staff and room allocation
    •	Streamline billing and insurance processes

Business Scenario:

    You are a Data Science Consultant hired by MediSure Hospitals, a healthcare network seeking to enhance diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency.

    The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) has asked your data science team to explore the dataset and deliver:
    •	Insights into patient demographics and medical patterns
    •	Performance analytics of hospitals and doctors
    •	Billing and insurance-related findings
    •	A predictive model for medical test outcomes

Success Metrics:

    Accuracy | Percentage of correct predictions | >= 80%
    Precision / Recall (Abnormal class)	| Model’s ability to correctly identify high-risk patients | >= 75%

Key Business Questions:

    The management has proposed a set of analytical questions to guide the investigation:

    Patient & Diagnosis Insights
    1.	What are the most common medical conditions among admitted patients?
    2.	Which age group has the highest proportion of abnormal test results?
    3.	Are there any gender differences in test outcomes?
    4.	Which blood types show higher rates of inconclusive results?

    Hospital & Operational Insights
    5.	Which hospitals have the highest abnormal or inconclusive result rates?
    6.	Is there a relationship between hospital stay duration (Discharge - Admission) and test result type?
    7.	Which admission type (Emergency, Elective, Urgent) shows more abnormal results?
    8.	Do some doctors consistently show more abnormal or inconclusive cases?

    Financial & Insurance Insights
    9.	Does the billing amount correlate with test results?
    10.	Which insurance providers are associated with higher billing and abnormal outcomes?
    11.	Are elective admissions generally more expensive than emergency ones?

    Medication & Treatment Insights
    12.	Which medications are most commonly prescribed for abnormal results?
    13.	Do specific condition-medication combinations improve outcomes?
    14.	Are certain medications linked with inconclusive test results?

    Strategic & Predictive Insights
    15.	Which combination of features (age, condition, medication, admission type) increases the likelihood of abnormal results?
    16.	Which factors are most predictive of abnormal test outcomes?
    17.	Can a predictive model help flag patients at high risk of abnormal or inconclusive results before testing?

Problem Statement:

    We need to build a predictive model that estimates whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days after being discharged from the hospital, based on their medical and demographic data.


Scope and Assumptions

    •	Data is synthetic but reflects real-world hospital structures.
    •	No personally identifiable information (PII).
    •	The goal is educational - to learn how healthcare analytics and predictive modelling work.

Expected Business Impact

    If successful, this project will:
    •	Improve patient risk management through early detection of abnormal cases.
    •	Enhance hospital efficiency by better resource planning.
    •	Reduce diagnostic delays and increase patient satisfaction.
    •	Demonstrate the power of data-driven healthcare decision-making.
